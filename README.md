# Deep-Neural-Network-Without-Library
This is a deep artificial neural network made from scratch with only numpy in jupyter notebook. For testing I have first used the XOR problem in which model is 95% sure for the correct output. Afterwards the model is tested on handwritten digits dataset (not MNIST because the images are 8x8 which is smaller than MNIST) in which model performs good.
